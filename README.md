# Odin-recipes
In this repository I'll be showcasing what i'm currently learning on TheOdinProject. Now, I jsut learn the HTML Basics, where I link a page to another, add links, 
Include images etc... That's a note for my future self to look back at my progress and also to showcase some of my newlly acquired skills.
